Hypothesis Testing: 
We always start the test considering null hpothesis is true.

1. define hypothesis:
	what you want to find out, choose the right metric that you want to evaluate
3. collect data:
	define features and collect data
3. formulate analysis:
		1. define significance level : alpha 
			probabilty of obtaining statistic significantly different from true statistic by chance / luck
			Can also be regarded is probility of making type 1 error ( false positive ) : which is alpha = 0.05 means that we are willing to take 5% risk of commiting type 1 error, i.e rejecting true null hypothesis.
		2. compute test statistic
		3. get the p value : 
			probibilty of sampling test statistic calculated from step 2 from distribution of true statistic
		4. Power analysis: probability of avoiding type 2 error = P(reject H_0 | H_a is true)



Type of test:

1. one sample :
	1. known mean known variance
		>30 : z test
		<30 : t test
	2. known mean unknown variance
		sample:
			t-test
	3. unknown mean known variance
		>30 : z test
		<30 : t test
	4. unknown mean unknown variance
			<30 : t-test
In unknown mean cases what we are essentially doing is we are doing hypothesis test on the population mean itself. So we have sample mean and we are trying to hypothesis test that sample is from certain population mean.

If the sample size is large enough, then the Z test and t-Test will conclude with the same results. For a large sample size, Sample Variance will be a better estimate of Population variance so even if population variance is unknown, we can use the Z test using sample variance.

Similarly, for a Large Sample, we have a high degree of freedom. And since t-distribution approaches the normal distribution, the difference between the z score and t score is negligible.

2. two sample 

3. sample propotion test

assumption:
1. normal 
2. random iid samples
