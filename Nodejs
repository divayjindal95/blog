Nodejs: 

Intro:
	way to run js on server and not limiting to browsers. 
	Nodejs is js runtime to run js on server built on chrome's v8 engine ( cpp )
	Runtime env is the env that is created for running a peace of code. 
	Hence nodejs provides c++ binding to do some extra tasks to v8 engine. Tasks such a access file system, open sockets etc run with the help of these bindings.
	Chrome browser is also just a runntime but with different functionalities ( such a access dom).
	Console.log is not part of js, rather it is  by runtime of both chrome and node.

What is callback:
	Any function given as arg in function is a callback. 
	Its not nesseacry that all the callback will be async. Only the one that are related to native node api as async.

Call stack, callback queue, Event loop:
	1. main() that is implicilty put by jit compiler is at the bottom of call stack.
	2. each function call is put into stack.
	3. Any time taking function or a function that is actually a part of libuv are handled by seperate pool of threads. 
	4. Pair of event and callback function is registered there.
	5. As and when event is executed, the callback is put into callback queue.
	6. When the call stack becomes empty, callback function is put into the call stack and then executed.

Standards:
	Follow the following standards:
		1. use const and let : better scoping
		2. Try to use arrow functions, also try place functions in const.
		3. use ===, put else in same line
