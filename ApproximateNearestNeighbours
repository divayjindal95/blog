ANN : Approximate nearest neighbours


1. Annoy Trees : Algo
	Build Tree : (it is a binary tree)
	1. Select two point at random and select hyperplane the bisect them
	2. Repeat 1 by select random points till there are only k point in a section
	3. Do 1 and 2 to create a forest.

	Similarity for K vector:
	1. Select the side of branch/hyperplane to which this vector lies.
	2. Iterate this till the end.
	3. Select the point in this closed figure.
	4. Repeat this for the forest and select top N closest.

	Time complexity for search is height of the tree.

2. LSH : Locality Sensitive Hashing
	Build Signature Matrix: ( D docs, P permutation )

	1. For n-gram create the column vectors for all the documents with 1/0 indicating if that gram is present in the document.
	2. Generate P permuation of row numbers.
	3. Note for that permutation for each doc the index at which first 1 is encountered.
	4. Do this for all the P.

	Build Hash:
	1. Select b each with r rows 
	2. Hash each portion of signature matrix into hash array.
	3. the colliding portions make the candidate documents similar.
