Basics of NLP:

Pre-processing :
	1. tokenization : 
		break word to token
	2. stemming : 
		remve morphological and inflexional endings from words in English
		porter's stemming is a 5 step process, it is a rule based algorithm
	3. lemmatization : 
		this is better than stemming as this considers context of the word .
	4. POS: 
		tag each word in sentence : Noun/Pronoun/Verb/Adverb/Adjective/Conjunction/Interjection/Preposition
		Dataset : Pess tree bank (wsj tagging )

		Many ways to achieve this:
			1. HMM
			2. MEMM
			3. Average Perceptron

	5. NER

Vector Creation:
	1. tfidf : 
	2. BM25 : 
	3. LSA : 
	3. Word2vec : 
		1. continous bag of words : 
		2. skip gram model : 
	4. Doc2vec : 
		1. Paragraph vector - Distributed bag of words
		2. Paragraph vector - 
	5. Glove:
	Use n-gram co-occurence matrix to create word vectors. 


Advance Techniques:
	1. RNN
	2. Bert
