# The Lean Startup : Enterprenuership is all about great managment.


1 Eric found that implementing ideas was not that easy, hence he researched and found this thing in manufacturing industry called lean manufacturing. 

## Vision
	
### 1. Start : start thinking - right and strong
		1 The goal of startup is to build right thing, thing that customer wants and will pay for.
		2. Dont build the rocket in one go, but build-measure-learn and iterate over it continously. 
		3, Have a clear vision, build strategy around it ( buisness model, product roadmanp, who customer will be, idea about competitors) and create the product. This is kind of pyramid, where vision rarley changes, strategy might change, product contiously changes.
		4. Startup is mix of many activites : ops, marketing, sales, product innovation, customer acquisition. Enterpreneurship is balancing these activites.
		It is all about management.
### 2. Define : define what is startup
		1. Startup : is human institution designed to create new product or service under extremely uncertain condition.
		2. Enterprenuer : who does this
		3. Sustainable innovationvs disruptive innovation, continious innovation is imperative. Keep experimenting and innovating.
3. Learn
	1. Learning is the oldest excuse in the book for a failure of execution. But is cold comfort the investors who are putting their precious money into it. Learning will not get you money. 
	2. We must learn what our customer really wants, and not what you think he wants. Learn what part of your strategies are working and what are failing. Learn are you really moving in direction of buidling sustainable buisness. 
	3. Validation learning is the way. Empirical means to discover valuable truths about startups present and future buisness prospects.
	4. The problem is customer dont know what they want. 
	5. *** Value is providing benefits to customer, everything else is a waste. But in startup who the customer is and what he wants are unknowns. Hence learning is essential part in startup, learning here is called validated learning backed by real empirical customer data. This way you reduce the wastefull effort building something no-one may use. This validated learning should shape the product and product strategy. It should not remain only as mere learning in your head. This empirical data can me collected by building small usable features(mvp)
	6. **Can it be built  vs Should it be built and Can we build a sustaibable buisness around this set of product and services.**
	
 4. Experiment : to learn experiment
	1. Value hypothesis : the product/service that you have created, do people really find usefull and valuable. Survey might not tell correctly as most people have har time accessing thier feeling. Through experiments you can actually measure metrics that would help you validate hypothesis.
	2. Growth Hypothesis : validates the growth of you product.
	3. Good part of expermentation ( mvp )  is that you will find actuall users that with more substantial and qualitative feedback as compared to market research.
	4. Experiment is the first product, strategies on whats happening today are anytime better than on what might happen tomorrow(mrket research). Question should be asked as :
		1. Do people identify it as a problem?
		2. will they buy it?
		3. will they buy it from you
		4. can you build it
		While developing product think in this order.
	Identify the assumptions, and figure out ways to test them

Steer

Above things gave an abstract about what is startup and marked the importance of learning and experimentation. 
It said that product startup build are really experiment that give learning about how the build sustainanle buisnesss out of it is the outcome of it.
Core principle : build-measure-learn
None is more important, main goal is to optimize on the total time through the loop.
As you see we are moving from vision to steer. 
Steer has following things :
	1. leap-of-faith : define assumptions and hypothesis on which everything depends.
	2. build : mvp
	3. measure :  
	4. learn : 


1. Leap of Faith :
